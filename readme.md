## About the app "Coder Pal"

This is an CRUD app where users are able to put their coding queries and fellow users are able to help answer them

## How the app works

When you open the app users are able to view the questions posted by all users but are unable to ask a question, answer the question, edit or delete them.
To do so, users will have to signup if they haven't and login. And from there, the users are able to ask/post a question, post an answer, edit or delete the question or answer. Based on the user-id, only the user-id who posted a question or an answer is the only one is able to edit or delete them but other logged-in users are abale to only view them. If a user is not logged-in they are just able to view all posted questions.

## My approach

1. Heading // CODER PAL//
2. refer to [wireframe](https://github.com/Pujap84/Project-2/tree/master/public/wireframes/project2%20wireframes) for all the wireframes

3. Following is the image which helped me plan my project and got me started

4. Then I planned out how I wanted each question to look like and how would the answers be displayed under. Folowwing is the wireframe for that

5. Following psql table outlined under was then made to help me plan out my tables

6. psql tables were created were then created on PostgreSQL

7. necessary coding was done with a lot of trial and errors to generate the needed routes which helps the user to login, ask questions, edit and delete them and reply to those questions, and to be able to edit and delete those answers.

8. with css the app was designed

9. The following Coder Pal app logo was then designed before deploying the app
